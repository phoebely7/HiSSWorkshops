## WiDS 2022 Beginner R Workshop

![](C:/Users/phoeb/OneDrive/Desktop/dsp.jpeg)

```{r load library}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

#Open up your dataset by typing out the name
diamonds

#Output column names
colnames(diamonds)

#The '?' opens up the help window
?diamonds

```


## Data Transformation

### Filter

Filtering your data allows you to pick observations based on their value (rows).

```{r filter}
#Outputs all unique categories in variable
#The $ specifies what column you want 
unique(diamonds$cut)

#Prints out all the diamonds with a Premium quality cut
diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Premium")

#Prints out all diamonds with a carat that's greater than 0.5
diamonds %>% filter(carat > 0.5)

#Combine the two conditions
diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Premium" & carat > 0.5)

#Filter the diamonds with the best quality cut and store it into a variable for easy access
my_diamonds <- diamonds %>% filter(cut == "Premium" | cut == "Ideal" | cut == "Very Good")

#Print
my_diamonds 

```

### Select

Allows you to subset your data by specifying variables by their name (columns).

```{r select}
#Subsets data by column name
my_diamonds %>% select(cut, color, price)

#You can specify a range of variables to print out
my_diamonds %>% select(price:z)

#Remove columns 'x', 'y', and 'z'
my_diamonds %>% select(-x, -y, -z)

#Store in the same variable name
temp <- my_diamonds %>% select(-x, -y, -z)

my_diamonds
```

### Mutate

You can create new variables, modify, and delete columns with mutate.

```{r mutate}
#Create a variable that describes a 10% OFF discount from the original price
my_diamonds %>% mutate(newPrice = price * .90)

my_diamonds %>% mutate(newPrice = price * .90, pricePerCarat = newPrice / carat)

#Add on another variable that describes the ratio of price to carat and store it
my_diamonds <- my_diamonds %>% mutate(newPrice = price * .90,
                                      pricePerCarat = newPrice / carat)
my_diamonds
```

### Group By, Summarise, and Arrange

group_by() is commonly used in conjunction with summarise() to gather statistics based on individual groups rather than the whole dataset.

arrange() allows you to change the order of the rows

```{r group by}
#Group the dataset into groups of 'color', and return the average price within each group
my_diamonds %>% group_by(color) %>% summarise(avgPrice = mean(price))

#You can group by multiple columns if you desire
my_diamonds %>% group_by(color, clarity)

#Arrange the diamonds dataset by price in ascending order
my_diamonds %>% arrange(desc(price))
```


## Data visualization

```{r some plots}
#Get frequency of each category
cut_freq <- table(my_diamonds$cut)
cut_freq #print

#Create barplot
barplot(cut_freq)

#Add aesthetics
barplot(cut_freq, main = "Counts by Cut", colour = "blue")
?barplot()
#Create histogram
hist(my_diamonds$carat, main = "Carat Distribution")
hist(my_diamonds$price, main = "Price Distribution")

#Create scatterplot
plot(my_diamonds$carat, my_diamonds$price, col = my_diamonds$clarity)
```

## Practice Questions

Load in the library "nycflights13" and play around with the "flights" dataset.

1) How many flights had an arrival delay of 2 or more hours?

2) How many unique carriers are there??

3) Sort flights to find the fastest flights. Hint: speed = distance / time

4) Show the distribution of distance. What does it look like?


```{r your code chunk}
#YOUR CODE HERE
```
